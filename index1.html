    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Anant, and I am a Class 9 student who is passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning. I love exploring the world of computers, especially web development, because it gives me the freedom to turn ideas into reality using code. I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, creating webpages, designing layouts, and experimenting with different styles to improve my skills. I have also learned how to use Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages, which helped me upload my projects online and publish my own working website. One of my proudest achievements was creating my own ID Card webpage and making it live on the internet, which taught me how to structure files, fix errors, and understand how websites actually function behind the scenes.

I believe in learning step-by-step, staying curious, and never hesitating to ask questions when something is difficult. My strengths include creativity, patience, problem-solving, and the ability to understand concepts clearly by practicing them. I enjoy building small projects, trying new ideas, and finding smarter ways to design simple, clean, and effective webpages. Every project I finish motivates me to learn even more. My goal is to keep expanding my knowledge, learn JavaScript next, and slowly build a strong foundation in computer science so that I can create bigger and more advanced projects in the future. I am confident that with dedication, hard work, and curiosity, I will continue to grow as a young developer and achieve great things in the world of technology.</p>
